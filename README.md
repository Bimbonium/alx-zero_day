I have to redo this project just because
I am currently using Vi to edit this file
It takes some getting used to (especially since I seem to find emacs
more intuitive)
It doesn't hurt to know how to use vi tho, since I might encouter it more
often

I am writing these parts with emacs, just feels nicer, I know it is a
psychological thing, but emacs >>> vi
Thank you for coming to my TEDtalk.

This probably flouts all the README rules that exists but erm, a little fun
hurts no one
